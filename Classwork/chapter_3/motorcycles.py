# Summary: This code demonstrates how to create and manipulate a list of motorcycles. 
# It shows how to add items to the list using the append() and insert() methods, 
# how to remove items using the del statement and the pop() method, and how to remove an item by value using the remove() method. 
# The code also includes print statements to display the contents of the list at various stages of manipulation.
